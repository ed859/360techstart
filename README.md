# 360techstart
This is a demonstration of how to create the repository and view the final project on the web. 
<script src='//vizor.io/static/scripts/vizor-360-embed.js' data-vizorurl='//vizor.io/embed/ed859/360techstart'></script>

To accomplish this we need to:

2. Create a 360 Vizor account
3. Place your Photo into Vizor and publish the project
4. Get the Embed Code From Vizor
5. Create a Github Account and create a new project
6. Place the embed code into the README.md file (or create an index.html)
7. Enable github pages through the settings for the master branch
7. You can view your finished work by typing  (your gethub username) + .gethub.com + (/your project name) into any browser!
